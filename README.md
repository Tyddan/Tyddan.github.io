# My wedding site

## Overview

The project is comprised of the following:

- `index.html` - Content
- `theme.css` - CSS Styling
- `/img` - Images
- `/js` - External Scripts (Smooth-scrolling)
- `/icons` - FontAwesome's Icon Library (See below for more details)

## Page Components

#### Header Instructions

To override the stock image, you have two options:

1. Replace `img/hero.jpeg` with your own image (but keep the filename the same).
2. Replace the header `background-image` file path in `theme.css` with the path to your image.


### Iconography

The icons are provided by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery).

#### Icon Instructions

To add/change icons, find the icon you like on their page and then use the following syntax to insert:

```<i class="fas fa-[ICON ID HERE]"></i>```

## Technical Details

This template makes use of a few external scripts but doesn't rely on any build scripts or anything like that. Big thanks to the following:

- [SmoothScroll](http://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll) - RSVP Scroll Functionality
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) - Iconography
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Fonts (Caveat and Quicksand)
